CLASS
  WINE

INHERITANCE
  System.Object
     Glass :  about_Glass.help.txt
       WineGlass : about_WineGlass.help.txt

DESCRIPTION
    The WineGlass class represents a glass of Wine. It is a subclass of the Glass class and its
    Wine property takes an instance of the Wine class.


CONSTRUCTORS
    WineGlass()

    
    WineGlass ( [Wine]$Wine, 
                [int] $Size, 
                [int] $Pour )

    -Wine:  An instance of the Wine glass.
    -Size:  The size of the glass in ounces. Valid values are 5-8.
    -Pour:  The amount of wine in the glass in ounces. Valid values are 0-5.


PROPERTIES
    Wine: An instance of the Wine class

    Size: (Inherited from Glass) 
          The size of the glass in ounces. Valid values are 5-8.

    CurrentAmount: (Inherited from Glass)
          The amount of wine in the glass in ounces. Valid values are 0-5.
          Set by the value of Pour in the WineGlass constructor. Changed by
          the Sip and Pour methods.


METHODS

   [int] Sip ([Int]$Ounces)
         Removes the specified number of ounces from the 
         CurrentAmount of Wine in the Glass.

         Returns the CurrentAmount value after the Sip. 

         If the value of $Ounces is greater than the CurrentAmount, the 
         method fails.


   [void] Sip()
         Calls the Sip method with 1 ounce. No return value.

         If the value of $Ounces is greater than the CurrentAmount, the 
         method fails.


   [int] Pour ([Int]$Ounces)
         Add the specified number of ounces to the 
         CurrentAmount of Wine in the Glass.

         Returns the CurrentAmount value after the Pour.

         If the Size of the WineGlass is too small to hold the CurrentAmount
         plus $Ounces, the method fails.
         

    [void] Refill()
         Adds Wine to glass to restore the inital CurrentAmound when the
         WineGlass was created. No return value.

         If the CurrentAmount is greater than or equal to the initial
         value of CurrentAmount, the method has no effect. (It writes
         a Verbose message, not an error.)
        
EXAMPLES:

    This example creates a 5-ounce WineGlass with 5 ounces of PSWine by
    Chateau Snover.

    [WineGlass]::new($PSWine, 5, 5)
