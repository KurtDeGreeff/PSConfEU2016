PSConfEU 2016
==========
Feel free to contribute, add stuff, mess around and so on

Why GitHub?
=========
Well, it started with the warmup session on friday. Tobias wanted to share a demo script, written during the session.
Counting the delegates in the session, he quickly realized, that "i'll put that on your sticks" couldn't be a solution.
The idea was, just to put it on GitHub, Tobias asked me to do that, and i did that.
So, we could try to collect all of the useful, presented stuff here.
I guess, the PSConf-Team will put their slides, demos and recorded sessions online as well.
But it's not only about collecting the stuff, created at the conference. 
GitHub is a great opportunity for us as a community, to stay in contact. We can discuss topics on Gitter, stay in touch, share ideas, problems and so on...
So that's the basic idea - evolved from the need to share just a few lines of code. 
Let's see, what can happen - there is no plan, there are no rules - maybe this isn't even a good idea.

Structure
=======
I thought the simplest structure would be separating everything by the day, underlying the single sessions.
Feel free to change that if you have better ideas ;)
I started adding .MD Files for a little documentation and reminder, what the session was about, who did it, what was interesting, links to blogs and and and...
If you arent familiar with MD files you can get the documentation here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Language
======
Considering the fact, that there has been a mix between englisch and german tracks, we should keep everything in englisch.
If slides are only available in german, we can translate them (we, not I ;) ).

=====
