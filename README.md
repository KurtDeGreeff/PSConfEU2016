PSConfEU 2016
==========
We're trying to collect all materials from the PSConfEU2016 here on GitHub.
Feel free to contribute, add stuff by submitting a pull request and so on...

I created this rep in the warmup session on friday.

Structure
=======
I thought the most simple structure would be separating everything by the day, underlying the single sessions.
Feel free to change that if you have better ideas ;)
AN .MD File for each session, describing shortly who did the session, what it was about and maybe some interesting URLs (eg blogs referenced, twitter accounts and stuff).
